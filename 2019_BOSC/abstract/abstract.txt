Biopython is a long-running distributed collaborative effort, a freely available Python library for biological computation. We summarise recent project news, and look ahead.

Releases 1.73 (December 2018) and 1.74 (expected May/June 2019) had incremental improvements, especially inline API documentation. Every public API should be documented this year.

In 2017 we started a transition away from our liberal but unique Biopython License Agreement to the similar but very widely used 3-Clause BSD License. Already half the files in the main library have been dual licensed after reviewing authorship, and all new contributions are dual licensed.

Improving test coverage is ongoing, currently fairly static at 85% (excluding online tests). Tests and Python PEP8/PEP257 style are checked with continuous integration on Linux (TravisCI) and Windows (AppVeyor). We may adopt the Python code formatting style tool black to reduce human time writing compliant code.

In 2020, in line with other scientific Python libraries, we will drop Python 2 support.

In the last year Biopython had 32 named contributors, including 14 newcomers. This reflects our policy of encouraging even small contributions. We expect to reach 250 contributors by our 20th Birthday in August 2019.
